# OSS_Lab4_Project_With_Business_Model

## About This Project

This project is a drag-and-drop data explorer which provides a user-friendly way to manipulate datasets and create visualizations without writing a single line of code.  Intended for those with little programming experience, this project allows users to upload datasets and then create a workflow to process them with drag-and-drop blocks.  A key element of this project is the ability to create clean, presentation-quality, visualizations via a series of configurable blocks.  Pre-made machine learning models can also be trained and applied with minimal background knowledge required.
